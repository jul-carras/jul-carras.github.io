      <description>Here is a next-step analysis jumping off of the web scraping and mapping post from a couple of months back. Showing points on a map is great for big picture visualizations, but what if we need to know a little more? Maybe we’re interested in relationships between points. Or specifically, how far are these point from each other? We can calculate euclidean distances between our points, but this doesn’t really translate to the real world.</description>

      <description>Web scraping is a fun way to build data sets for analyses. Mapping is a great way to get an almost-literal 30 thousand mile view of a market, setting the stage for exploring potential opportunities. For a recent assignment, I built a map showing Dillard’s department stores along with the locations of 2 other retailers we’re associated with.
With guidance from this post by Saurav Kaushik, I used the Selector Gadget tool, which is a Chrome add-on that extracts out XPath and CSS selectors directly on a website.</description>
