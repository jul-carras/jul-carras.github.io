      <description>Hey There!I am a business analyst at Chaco Footwear and am working on my masterâ€™s in data science at Grand Valley University in Grand Rapids, MI.
I grew up in the Bronx and learned how to commute early while attending highschool in Harlem. Guidance from a favorite teacher of mine landed me at the University of Michigan. I left Ann Arbor with a degree in Applied Mathematics and have been an analyst ever since.</description>
