      <title>Web Scraping and Mapping</title>

      <description>Web scraping is a fun way to build data sets for analyses. Mapping is a great way to get an almost-literal 30 thousand mile view of a market, setting the stage for exploring potential opportunities. For a recent assignment, I built a map showing Dillard’s department stores along with the locations of 2 other retailers we’re associated with.
With guidance from this post by Saurav Kaushik, I used the Selector Gadget tool, which is a Chrome add-on that extracts out XPath and CSS selectors directly on a website.</description>

      <title>A/B Testing Case Study</title>

      <description>I got the opportunity to try out an A/B testing analysis using some fabricated traffic data. The data was even provided with a hypothesis to check! The below covers the presented hypothesis, background information, a full statistical analysis, and next-step suggestions.
Let me know what you think! Happy Scrolling.
PackagesAll of the data was in an Excel spreadsheet, so I used readxl to import. For wrangling, I brought in dplyr via the tidyverse package.</description>

      <description>Consider it an early birthday present to myself.While my summer courseload is winding down, I wanted to spend some time putting together a site. Most folks in the data science community suggest some type of presence - partially for visibility, but mostly to get your thoughts and projects in one place. I’ve done my fair share of googling how-to-do-this-thing-in-R, so it’s about time I contribute back.
I’ve got an applied math degree from the University of Michigan and am currently enrolled in a relatively new data science program at Grand Valley State University.</description>

      <description>Hello Friend.I am a business analyst at Chaco Footwear and am working on my master’s in data science at Grand Valley State University in Grand Rapids, MI.
I am from the Bronx and attended the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. I left with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics and have been an analyst ever since.
Coming from the city, I got into outdoor activities relatively late in life and I’ve been making up for lost time.</description>
